# Creating New Problems

## Requirements

To create a new problem, you must have the following content available:

### Title

You must assign the problem a suitable title, which will be used as an identifier while creating problem-solving sessions. The name should always be unique, and cannot be changed later.

### Notebook URLs

You can add multiple notebook URLs (via google colab) that can be used to connect to the problem-solving session. It is your responsibility to distribute the URLs to the students, and in case of multiple URLs, to distribute them correctly. EASEx will block any sessions from all other possible URLs.

### Answers
