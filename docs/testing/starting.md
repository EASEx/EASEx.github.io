# Starting Tests Manually

Whilst we have thoroughlly tested EASEx in multiple scenarios, there can be some cases, where a test may not start at the given time. This can occur due to circumstances beyond our control like:

- The server has been setup in a different timezone from the client i.e. there is a offset between server and client. Hence, the test will start only at the server time.
- The server crashed while the test was being started. Note, that the server will automatically start the test if it crashed after the test was started.

Also, in some cases the instrcutor may immediately want to start a test instead of waiting for a specific time.

In such scenarioss, you can navigate to the schedule test tab in "tests", click on the name of the test you want to start, and click on start. This will immediately start the test.
