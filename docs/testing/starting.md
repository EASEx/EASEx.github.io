# Starting Sessions Manually

Although we have thoroughly tested EASEx in multiple scenarios, there may be some cases where a problem-solving session may not start at the given time. This can occur due to circumstances beyond our control, for example:

- The server has been setup in a different timezone from the client, i.e., there is an offset between the server and client. Hence, the problem-solving session will start only at the server time.
- The server crashed while the problem-solving session was being started. Note that the server will automatically start the problem-solving session if it crashed after the session was started.

Further, in some cases an instructor or course designer may immediately want to start a problem-solving session instead of waiting for a specific time. In such scenarios, please navigate to the schedule test tab in "tests", click on the name of the problem-solving session you want to start, and click on start. This will immediately start the session.
