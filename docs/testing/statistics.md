# Monitoring Sessions

The administrator dashboard also provides in-house live monitoring of all the metrics previosly discussed in the concepts. The primary purpose of monitoring is to allow the
instructor to decide whether his rules are working as expected or not.

:::tip

Before we proceed, it is important that you fully understand all the concepts and metrics that have been discussed. Since the actions that the students undertake during the session are non deterministic, there are no ideal metrics as such. If you feel that metrics are way off, it may not always be an issue with the settings you have provided but rather might be an issue with student's actions.

:::

The metrics that are visible are solely dependent upon the rules that you have set, and thus we omit any generalized explanation.
