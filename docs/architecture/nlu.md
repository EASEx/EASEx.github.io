# NLU

The NLU ( Natural Language Unit ) lies at the heart of our platform and is responsible for the following processes:

## Python Parsing

The NLU has a built-in python parses that can extract all modules and functions used in a python script. The parser works primiarly by analyzing the AST generated by the interpreter.

For example, the following code is resolved into:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot()
import seaborn
seaborn.__version__()
from matplotlib.pyplot import plot
plot()
```

```json
"modules": [
        {"name": "matplotlib.pyplot", "as": "plt"},
        {"name": "seaborn", "as": "seaborn"},
        {"name": "matplotlib.pyplot.plot", "as": "plot"},
],
"functions" : [
        "matplotlib.pyplot.plot",
        "seaborn.__version__",
        "matplotlib.pyplot.plot",
]
```

Also, the parses is capable of resolving renames which may incidentally occur and also ignores any EASEx propritary code.

:::danger
The parser only resolves upto a synactically correct code. All cells after an incorrect syntax would be automatically ignored. As such it becomes important that you should ask
students to not leave any incorrect cells in between.

## Answer Checking

The NLU is also responsible for answer checking, which has been discussed in detail previously [here](../testing/create.md). Answer checking is not 100% accurate like any machine learning algorithm and heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the answers and training data. This has only been provided as feature to allow scaffoldings dependent on current answer in tests where the student can answer multiple times. Either way, the onus still lies upon you to not use this for actual grading.

_Whilst both speech generation and text to speech are integrally related to the NLU, we still use them in 3D renderer which considerably increases our rendering speed._
