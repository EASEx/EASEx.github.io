# Scaffold Types

- Cognitive — strategies for presenting new scaffolds as ideas
  - _It seems you have been struggling with integrating function X in your code. Why don't you try working with function Y?_
  - _We need to raise the bar for you now. Consider the effect of using strategy Z in your work._
  - _Consider running your solution on a different dataset D? How does it perform?_
- Metacognitive — strategies for self-explaining, time management and planning, engaging in reflection etc
  - _Take a moment to reflect on your problem-solving strategy. Please note down the cases when it does not seem to work._
  - _Consider the time remaining and pace yourself to generate at least three-five solutions to the problem._
  - _Try to explain different steps of your solution, as if you were teaching your peer._
- Affective — strategies for emotion regulation 
  - _It is okay to feel frustrated in the task._ 
  - _When I feel frustrated on difficult tasks, it motivates me to try harder and keeps me on my feet._ 
  - _Don't be too happy with small successes. Remember that the canonical solution may not be straightforward._
- Motivational — strategies to make students persist (directed praise, error encouragement)
  - _Remember that this is a safe space to generate and explore ideas._
  - _It is okay to not get to a right answer immediately as long as you try different ways to make sense of the problem._
  - _You have not quit even with this tough problem._
  - _Congratulations, you put in the effort to succeed in implementing function X._
- Relational — strategies for building rapport (self-disclosure, referring to shared experience, praise, violation of social norms)
  - _I find this problem challenging too._ 
  - _When I feel frustrated on difficult tasks, it motivates me to try harder and keeps me on my feet._ 
  - _Remember when we faced a similar issue in the past problem, we dealt with it calmly._
  - _Congratulations, you put in the effort to succeed in implementing function X._
  - _It seems you are barely taking up my recommendations in your work._
